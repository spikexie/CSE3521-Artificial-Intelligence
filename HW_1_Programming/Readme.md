# Homework 1

## Submission instructions

* Due date and time: September 21st (Monday), 11:59 pm ET

* Expected time commitment: 4-8 hrs

* Carmen submission: 
1) Submit one .py file with the search algorithms you implemented: `search.py`
2) Submit a `collaboration.txt` and list with whom you have discussed about the homework (see more details below). 

Please use python3 and write your own solutions from scratch. Do not import any packages yourself except for those we have included and specified.

* Collaboration: You may discuss with your classmates. However, you need to write your own solutions and submit separately. In your submission, you need to list with whom you have discussed about the homework in a .txt file `collaboration.txt`. Please list each classmateâ€™s name.number (e.g., chao.209) as a row in the .txt file. That is, if you discussed with two classmates, your .txt file will have two rows. If you did not discuss with your classmates, just submit an empty `collaboration.txt`. Please consult the syllabus for what is and is not acceptable collaboration.


## Introduction

Download or clone this repository. This code, and the idea for the assignment, comes from [UC Berkeley](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~cs188/pacman/home.html).

* Open up the Windows Command Line or Mac Terminal or Linux Terminal.

* Change your directory to the folder with the pacman code. You should see a file called `commands.txt` and three folders: `py`, `layouts` and `test_cases` .

* Run some of these commands (as listed in `commands.txt`) to make sure your setup works. Below are some examples:

```
python3 py/pacman.py
```

```
python3 py/pacman.py --layout tinyMaze --pacman GoWestAgent
```

* Make sure you can execute pacman. See what happens when you run the following command:

```
python3 py/pacman.py --layout tinyMaze --pacman GoWestAgent
```

### Implementation
* Please implement the "graph" search version, not the tree search version of each algorithm. That is, you will create a closeset, and you will not expand the already expanded states again.

* Once you finish your implementation, you can execute the autograder by

```
python3 py/autograder.py
```

* We note that, the provided commands are designed to work with Mac/Linux with Python version 3. If your are using Windows (like me!), you can use the COMMAND LINE (CMD), and make the following changes: (1) Please use \ instead of / while specifying the path to the file. (2) If it still does not work, you may try replacing "python3" with "py -3" in the command you're executing on CMD. Example command that works for us: "py -3 py\autograder.py"

## Task 1 (10 pts)

Open the file `py/search.py` and find the function [`depthFirstSearch`](./py/search.py#L70). 

Take the provided template and finish the code so that depth-first search works. 

You can test it with pacman by running the following command: 

```
python3 py/pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=dfs
```

## Task 2 (10 pts)

Open the file `py/search.py` and and find the function [`breadthFirstSearch`](./py/search.py#L90). 

Take the template and finish the BFS alorithm.  

You can test it with pacman by running the following command: 

```
python3 py/pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs
```

(Note that this should be simple if you've completed Task 1.)


## Task 3 (10 pts)

Open the file `py/search.py` and find the function  [`uniformCostSearch`](./py/search.py#L96). 

Take the template and finish the code so that UCS works. 

You can test it with pacman by running the following command: 

```
python3 py/pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ucs 
```

(Note that adapting your implementation of DFS or BFS maybe useful for UCS.)



### Useful Python code

Task 3 above asks you to implement UCS for Pacman. So, you want to have an openset that's ordered by a heuristic value. Python has `heaps` for this purpose. Whenever you `pop` a value from a heap, the lowest value comes out. Use a tuple to keep the value and other data together.

```
from util import heappush, heappop
openset = []
heappush(openset, (5, "foo"))
heappush(openset, (7, "bar"))
heappush(openset, (3, "baz"))
heappush(openset, (9, "quux"))
best = heappop(openset)
print(best)
```


## Task 4 (10 pts)

Open the file `py/search.py` and find the function  [`aStarSearch`](./py/search.py#L109). 

Finish the implementation of A* search. You can use the argument heuristic as a function: `dist = heuristic(state, problem)`

You can test it with pacman by running the following command: 

```
python3 py/pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic

```

## Other information

### Evaluation

Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. Please do not change the names of any provided functions or classes within the code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. However, the correctness of your implementation -- not the autograder's judgements -- will be the final judge of your score. 

* Discussion: Please be careful not to post spoilers.
* Helpful Reading: [Path Finding Algorithms](https://medium.com/omarelgabrys-blog/path-finding-algorithms-f65a8902eb40),  [BFS and DFS](https://eddmann.com/posts/depth-first-search-and-breadth-first-search-in-python/)


### Important Tips

Keep these things in mind while working on your solutions!
* All of your search functions need to return a list of actions that will lead the agent from the start to the goal. These actions all have to be legal moves (valid directions, no moving through walls).
* Make sure to use the `Stack`, `Queue` and `PriorityQueue` data structures provided to you in `py/util.py`! These data structure implementations have particular properties which are required for compatibility with the autograder.
* Get familiar with the methods in the `SearchProblem` class in `py/search.py`! You'll need to use these methods as part of your search implementations.
* Remember that lists in Python are passed by reference; if you're seeing actions show up in a list that shouldn't be there, make sure you're copying your actions to a new list every time!
* The autograder is not the final word! It is very possible to correctly implement these algorithms, but have the autograder consider it wrong because you didn't use the right data structures or methods. Final grades will be assigned by examining your implementation, not just using the autograder output.


####  Files you'll edit and submit :
* `py/search.py`: Where your search algorithms will reside.

#### Files you'll want to take a look at:
* `py/searchAgents.py`: Where all search-based agents are defined.
* `py/util.py`: Useful data structures you'll need for defining search algorithms.

#### Supporting files you can ignore (unless you're curious):


* `py/pacman.py`: The main file that runs Pacman games. This file describes a `Pacman` `GameState` type, which you use in this project.
* `py/game.py`: The logic behind how the Pacman world works. This file describes several supporting types like `AgentState`, `Agent`, `Direction`, and `Grid`.
* `py/graphicsDisplay.py`: Graphics for Pacman
* `py/graphicsUtils.py`: Support for Pacman graphics
* `py/textDisplay.py`: ASCII graphics for Pacman
